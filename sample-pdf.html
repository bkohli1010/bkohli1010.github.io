</p>
<p>2.1 Inspect the Ford Plug-In Modem&rsquo;s mounting location for surface prep. 
</p>
<p>2.1.1 The modem&rsquo;s mounting position is inside the IP on (driver side) below the HVAC duct and the 
headlamp switch module. This location is accessed from the driver foot well.  Visually inspect 
the surface to ensure it is free of any contaminants.  
</p>
<p> 
2.2 Promoter application instructions 
</p>
<p>The kit contains a 3M 4298 promoter packet and an adhesive backed mounting pad for mounting the 
Ford Plug-In Modem.  (Please follow the 3M application instructions included in the next step to 
prepare the mounting surface for the loop pad.) 
</p>
<p> 
3M 4298 Application instructions - Hold the packet upright and avoid squeezing the packet. The packet can be 
opened by tearing across the packet at the notches. This will expose the sponge applicator. Do not remove the 
sponge or squeeze a freshly opened packet to prevent spillage. Handling the bottom section of the packet 
should enable application of 3M adhesion promoter 4298 with no mess. Apply a thin, uniform coating to the 
bonding surface, using the minimum amount that will fully coat the surface. A wet coating thickness of 0.002 inch 
or less is recommended. Apply promoter to the areas that will be covered with adhesive side of mounting pad. 
Although drying times may vary due to temperature and/or humidity, a drying time of 30 to 90 seconds is typically 
indicative of this thickness. The promoter should be dry before applying pad. Reference: 3M. &ldquo;Adhesion 
Promoter 4298 for Professional Market Applications.&rdquo;  3M Multimedia, March-2003. Web. 22-July-2014

</p>
<p>2.3 Application of promoter to the mounting surface.  
</p>
<p>2.3.1 Apply a thin coating of promoter to the cleaned surface highlighted area pictured above in the 
surface prep section. 
 
</p>
<p>2.4 Application of the mounting pad on the prepared surface. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Surface prep: the mounting surface is highlighted in the pictures to left; the 
surface should be clean and dry.  
</p>
<p>&bull; Clean the surface area slightly larger than the mounting pad with the 
isopropyl alcohol wipe provided before applying the 3M promoter. 
</p>
<p>3M 4298 packet contains an applicator sponge soaking in promoter liquid - the 
liquid contents of the packet should be used as soon as possible after opening. 
</p>
<p>Note: the promoter must be dry before applying the mounting pad: dry 
time is 30 to 90 seconds after promoter application and not more than 
one hour. Make sure the primed surface remains free from 
contaminants prior to pad application. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Remove the clear plastic from the adhesive on the pad and apply 
the pad to the prepared surface; use picture to the right as a guide. 
Firmly rub pad into place, removing any air bubbles trapped under 
pad to ensure good adhesion to the surface.
